"Finite state machine"

What can be generalized between Mob and Player? 

Mobs don't need to contain hp etc... is it worth generalizing if there will be more code to write/irrelevant fields???

TODO:
[ ] Fix all new instances of FieldWorld to contain new states
[ ] TreasureCoord needs to be stored across states...

[ ] Generalize FieldObject data container


[ ] Add treasure collision detection
	- Use adapter function for this

Generalize FieldWorld states?
Generalize player states?
