"Finite state machine"

What can be generalized between Mob and Player? 

Mobs don't need to contain hp etc... is it worth generalizing if there will be more code to write/irrelevant fields???

TODO:
[x] Fix all new instances of FieldWorld to contain new states
[x] TreasureCoord needs to be stored across states...


[ ] Add treasure collision detection
	- Use adapter function for this

[ ] Research key presses
[x] Key handling for BattleWorld


# Later additions

[ ] Sound
[ ] Beyonce mode
